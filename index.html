		<h2>Icons <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Fonts</h2>
		<p>We love icons. Many of the navigational components in this style
	library rely on icons, which unfortunately we could not include in this release due to licensing requirements (we are not authorized to redistribute them). They have been replaced in the PSD files with “placeholders” (a circle labeled ICON). You’ll need to swap these out with your own icons.</p>
		<p>We highly recommend <a href="http://iconmonstr.com">Iconmonstr</a>, a huge library of beautifully- drawn, free-to-use icons.</p>
		<p>The fonts we used are from Google’s excellent (and free) library:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Display: </dt>
				<dd><a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Bitter"><strong>Bitter</strong></a></dd>
				<dt>Body: </dt>
				<dd><a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans"><strong>Open Sans</strong></a></dd>
			</dl>
		<p>Download and install before you open the PSD.</p>
